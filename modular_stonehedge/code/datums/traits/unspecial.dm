After attaining power, Levishth has cursed your people, bringing bad omens where ever you go. For this reason, the people of Stonehedge have shunned you and discriminated against you, there is no possible way an antediluvian will ever hold a position of power in Stonehedge, let alone be welcomed. Levishth has only shown favor to one antediluvian, rewarding them with the title of Vampire Lord, and gifting them powers far beyond that of a regular nitecreacher. Your pale skin, fangs, and eerie eyes are EASILY identifable features, so it is best to stay covered at all times in public areas."
