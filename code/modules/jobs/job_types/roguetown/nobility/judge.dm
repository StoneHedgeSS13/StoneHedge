You've traveled here to help enforce some semblance with the various parties; such as the Guilds, Druids temples, Ranger sentinels and Hedge Knights. You have studied chronomancy and gravity spheres of magick to cause what many perceive as 'universal lag' to the fray of otherwise lawless places; as well as creating decrees that set into the leylines when so chosen. Your magic has forged rulers and even dynasties; and many will try to defy them if you are not a truly just lawmancer."
